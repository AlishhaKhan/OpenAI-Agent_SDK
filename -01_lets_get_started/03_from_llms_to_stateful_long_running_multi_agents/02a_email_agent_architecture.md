# Email Management Agent Architecture  

The **Email Management Agent** is designed to automate and assist with handling emails by combining **event-driven architecture (EDA)**, **three-tier microservices architecture**, **stateless computing**, **scheduled tasks (CronJobs)**, and **human-in-the-loop (HITL)**.  
This architecture ensures scalability, reliability, and user control, while maintaining efficiency in email monitoring, filtering, and response management.

## Requirements  

### Functional Requirements  
- **Email Monitoring and Filtering**  
  - Continuously monitor incoming emails.  
  - Apply predefined rules or AI categorization (spam, urgent, casual, etc.).  
  - Notify users of filtered emails along with suggested responses.  

- **Suggested Responses**  
  - Analyze email content with NLP or templates.  
  - Provide contextual reply suggestions to users for approval.  

- **Response Approval and Sending**  
  - Allow users to approve, edit, or reject responses.  
  - Send approved responses automatically.  

- **New Email Creation**  
  - Enable users to compose new emails.  
  - Check grammar, tone, and clarity.  
  - Present corrected version for approval before sending.  

### Non-Functional Requirements  
- **Scalability** → Handle multiple users and large volumes of email.  
- **Real-Time** → Prompt processing and notifications.  
- **Reliability** → Ensure no missed or unsent emails.  
- **Usability** → Intuitive interface for review and approvals.  
- **Learning** → Improve suggestions based on user feedback over time.  

---

## User Stories  
- As a user, I want to be notified of new emails with suggested replies.  
- As a user, I want to approve or edit suggestions before sending.  
- As a user, I want to compose emails with correction support before sending.

## Architecture Overview  

The Email Agent integrates multiple architectural patterns:  

- **Three-Tier** → Presentation (UI), Business Logic (agents), Data (storage).  
- **EDA** → Events trigger email checks, filtering, approvals, and notifications.  
- **Stateless Computing** → Scalable processing functions (Lambdas/containers).  
- **CronJobs** → Scheduled email polling and feedback aggregation.  
- **HITL** → Users remain in control of approvals and corrections.

## Components and Workflow  

### 1. Three-Tier Architecture  
- **Presentation Layer**  
  - Web/mobile app for reviewing filtered emails, approving/rejecting responses, and composing new emails.  
  - Notifications for incoming emails.  

- **Business Logic Layer**  
  - **Email Monitoring Agent** → Detects and filters new emails.  
  - **Response Generator** → Suggests replies using NLP.  
  - **Email Composer Agent** → Suggests corrections for user-composed emails.  
  - **HITL Coordinator** → Manages approval workflows.  

- **Data Layer**  
  - Stores metadata, categories, suggestions, user feedback, and HITL states.  
  - Uses **PostgreSQL** for persistence and **Redis** for caching.  

### 2. Event-Driven Architecture  
- **Events**:  
  - `NewEmailReceived`, `EmailFiltered`, `HumanReviewRequired`, `HumanResponseReceived`, `EmailSent`.  
- **Workflow**:  
  1. `NewEmailReceived` → Email filtered.  
  2. `EmailFiltered` → Response generated.  
  3. `HumanReviewRequired` → User reviews/edit.  
  4. `HumanResponseReceived` → Approved email sent.  

### 3. Stateless Computing  
- **Email Processor** → Stateless filtering and categorization.  
- **Response Generator** → Generates contextual replies.  
- **HITL Handler** → Presents tasks for approval.  
- **Email Sender** → Sends final emails via SMTP/API (e.g., SendGrid).  

### 4. Scheduled Computing (CronJobs)  
- **Email Poller** → Regularly checks inbox if real-time API unavailable.  
- **Feedback Aggregator** → Collects user feedback daily to retrain models.  

### 5. Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)  
- Ensures users approve corrections and responses.  
- Keeps humans in charge of sensitive communications.

## Example Workflow  

- **Incoming Email**:  
  1. Boss sends: *"Meeting at 3 PM?"*.  
  2. Detected as urgent → Suggests *"Yes, I’ll be there."*  
  3. User approves → Email sent.  

- **New Email**:  
  1. User drafts: *"I cant make it."*  
  2. System suggests correction → *"I can’t make it."*  
  3. User approves → Email sent.

## Benefits  
- **Real-Time** → Faster email processing via EDA.  
- **Scalable** → Stateless microservices handle high volumes.  
- **User-Centric** → HITL ensures control and trust.  
- **Structured** → Clear separation of UI, logic, and data.  

---

## Challenges  
- **API Limits** → Risk of hitting polling limits; webhooks are preferred.  
- **Suggestion Quality** → Dependent on robust NLP and feedback loops.

In summary, this **Email Agent Architecture** balances **automation with human oversight**, ensuring reliability, scalability, and user trust while streamlining email management.
